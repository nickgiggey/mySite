# Project1
Welcome to Giggapedia!

When you first arrive, you will be greated in a true 80's styling of soft, yet piercing colors.
- At the top you'll have easy to navigate tabs to direct you to wherever you want to want to go. 
- To your right, please feel free to check out the corresponding site with the logo. For example... to view my LinkedIn profile, click on the square icon with the two letters "i" and "n" inside.
- Getting tired of viewing that lovely sunset? Scroll down to allow the main content to be brought front and center. 
- Navigate through each information box but if you feel the need to stretch out a bit, hop on the FingerCiser and scroll a few laps. How far did you go?
- Need to step away from all that content? Scroll down again for a beautiful city night view.
- If you're needing a quick Christmas-fix or simply need some distraction, scroll down again and click away on our Christmas lights.
- After all that scrolling and crisp workout on the FingerCiser, your finger must be tired... so click on the arrow icon at the bottom right and it'll bring you right back to the top!

Sure, this website may be dedicated to me and my life's accomplishments but that's doesn't mean I won't keep adding features for you to enjoy while you read about my greatness.

If you're accessing this site through my GitHub link, simply start by clicking on "Project1" on my main GitHub portal followed by copying the link from the green "Code" button roughly located at the top right. Take that link, go to your terminal, and enter "git clone".

My site is still very new and only the foundation has been laid so keep coming back to see updates on formating, visual appeal, addition content like updates in my hobbies... oh and check out my movie prop company's (Movie Relics) content in the links provided. Thank you very much for stopping by and feel free to email me with any recommendations! nickgiggey@comcast.net
